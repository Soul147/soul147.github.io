		<h2>Alpha 0.3 - March 2019 - Surpassing NG++</h2>
		<list>
		<h3>NG↑↑ Updates:</h3>
			<li>Added first 10 omni-upgrades.</li>
			<li>Finished first 4 omni-challenges.</li>
			<li>Pushed end-game to 1e100 OP.</li>
			<li>Added more omni-milestones - you can now keep eternity upgrades and eternity challenges on omnipotence.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug where you had to go omnipotent 1 more time than necessary for the milestone to be applied.</li>
			<li>omni-milestones require 3x more omni-stat instead of 5x.</li>
			<li>Removed buff to tickspeed threshold for time dimensions. It was way too overpowered. An upgrade for it will probably be added later, though.</li>
			<li>OC1 reward nerfed: ^(Math.log10(bought) / 10) > ^((Math.log10(bought) - 1) / 50 + 1)</li>
			<li>OC2 requirement greatly reduced.</li>
			<li>Unlocking dilation requires 1e100 OP. (You can't get to 1e100 OP yet, so it's basically disabled for now.)</li>
			<li>Passive TT gen upgrade cost increased again (1e25 DT > 1e30 DT)</li>
			<li>omni-dimensions scale now, similar to normal dimensions. Hopefully this fixes the true Infinity issue.</li>
			<li>Requirement for "Dilation was a bad idea" increased (1e10 TP > 1e15 TP)</li>
			<li>Achievement rewards work now. (This took me way too long to fix)</li>
		<h3>Other updates:</h3>
			<li>You can actually get to this changelog by clicking the Changelog button.</li>
			<li>Aarex has finally noticed that I forked his project... He added my theme to the official NG+++ repository. :)</li>
			<li>When using the void theme, you can actually read the text in the popups.</li>
			<li>Secret achievement base can now be adjusted to suit your needs. (It used to be set to a static 1.5)</li>
			<li>Hide tabs used in NG↑↑ when they haven't been unlocked or you are in another mode.</li>
			<li>Fixed bug where the secret achievement base would automatically reset to 1.5 on refresh, which could mess up stuff.</li>
			<li>Fixed bug where time study costs wouldn't show up when outside of NG↑↑.</li>
			<li>Fixed bug which prevented the notation from being anything other than scientific, no matter what you set it to.</li>
			<li>Fixed bug where when exiting NG↑↑ and playing another mode the study costs would stay increased until page refresh.</li>
			<li>Fixed NaN bug with omni-upgrade 6.</li>
			<li>Still haven't imported Tree of Decay and the other recent Aarex updates. I'm waiting until he finishes Ghostify so I can do it all at once.</li>
			<li><span id = "forge" style = "color: #111">something big is coming...</span></li>
		</list>
		<h2>Alpha 0.2 - February 2019 - I still hate doing things... but I did them anyway.</h2>
		<list>
		<li>Aarex released yet another update, and I need to merge it with this one. Hopefully this stops happening so frequently...</li>
		<h3>NG↑↑ Updates:</h3>
			<li>Current expected late-game values are literally Infinity. Don't buy the 5th-8th time dimensions for now, it breaks stuff.</li>
			<li>Added omni-challenges (WIP).</li>
			<li>Created system where you need to get more gravitons to unlock new replicators.</li>
			<li>Fixed the 0x multiplier to infinity dimensions and time dimensions when you have 0 gravitons.</li>
			<li>Fixed the Infinitex multiplier to omni-dimensions when you have 0 replicators.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug that would display omni-dimensions as unbuyable when you had exactly the amount of OP as the cost.</li>
			<li>Nerfed graviton multiplier exponent ( 7 > 4 ).</li>
			<li>Nerfed replicator multiplier exponent ( 8 > 3 ).</li>
			<li>Added 5 omnipotence milestones. They each require 5 times more omni-stat to unlock, and preserve more and more of the early game content, similar to eternity milestones and quantum speedruns.</li>
			<li>Removed nerf on multiplier per 10 dimensions.</li>
			<li>Post-infinity upgrade 3 makes galaxies an additional 19% stronger. (Nice.)</li>
			<li>Free tickspeed upgrade threshold reduced ( 1.33 > 1.25 / 1.25 > 1.2 with time study 171 ).</li>
			<li>Buffed time study 31's power ( 4 > 10 ).</li>
			<li>Buffed time study 32. It now gets infinities based on dimension boosts squared.</li>
			<li>Improved Eternity Upgrade 1's formula ( x+1 > x^1.5+1 ).</li>
			<li>Improved Eternity Upgrade 2's formula ( (x/200)^log4(2x) > x^log(x)^3.75 ). It's the same as the post-1e12 eternities one from NG+++.</li>
			<li>Improved Eternity Upgrade 3's base power ( 2 > 10 ).</li>
			<li>Tachyon Particle rebuyable upgrade 3 quadruples the TP gain instead of tripling.</li>
			<li>Time Theorem generation upgrade from time studies cost is increased ( 1e15 > 1e25 ).</li>
			<li>All time studies before the light-dark splits cost 3 times as much. After that point they cost 100 times as much.</li>
		<h3>Other updates:</h3>
			<li>QoL completes all ECs at 1e1300 EP instead of completing them gradually, because it was way too overpowered.
		<h3>Broken stuff:</h3>
			<li>Tree of Decay isn't in this update yet.</li>
			<li>NG↑↑ tabs don't hide in other modes.</li>
			<li>Rewards for the last 2 achievements do not work.</li>
			<li>NG---: Tickspeed Boost autobuyer is thoroughly broken... it doesn't work almost ever. I'm going to let Aarex fix this one, he said he'd work on NG---, I hope that means fixing it.</li>
		</list>
		<h2>Alpha 0.1 - January 2019 - I hate doing things.</h2>
		<list>
		<li>Right about now is when I took over from Aarex with development, at least of these mods. (I hope he's still working on stuff, and that it's easy to import into this so I don't have to rewrite everything.)</li>
		<li>Fixed a bunch of issues with the mode selection UI.</li>
		<li>Added Achievements++ and the QoL and Secrets mods. (Achievements++ isn't complete yet, there's still lots of things I need to add, which I'll do eventually.)</li>
		<h3>NG↑ Updates:</h3>
			<li>Started the Arrow Notation project, a series of mods that get you farther and farther into the late game.</li>
			<li>Added NG^ as the first mod of the Arrow Notation set. (It's not under NG+ anymore.)</li>
			<li>Added 4 new achievements for NG↑↑.</li>
			<li>Added omni-dimensions and gravitons.</li>
			<li>Added replicators.</li>
		<h3>Broken stuff:</h3>
			<li>IT'S TIME FOR BREAK_BREAK_INFINITY.JS <button onclick = "document.getElementById('rant').style.display = ''; this.innerHTML = 'Well, here you go'" style = "opacity: 0">Show my rant about big numbers</button><span id = "rant" style = "display: none"><br><br>(Both break_infinity.js and logarithmica_numerus_lite.js, though they're advertised to be able to store numbers up to a hardcap of 1e1e308, have a softcap at 10^9 quadrillion. At this point the computer doesn't store the numbers precise enough to have any degree of accuracy when dealing with numbers that are orders of magnitude smaller - for example, the multiplier per 10 dimensions being x2 when you have a total multiplier of 1e1e69 will have a negligible effect unless you buy billions of dimensions at the same time and apply all of their multipliers at once instead of individually (which leads to problems of its own). If you don't then it just ignores the multiplication altogether or gets the number wrong by several orders of magnitude. The numbers are just so big at this point that if you multiply them by 10 or 100 or even 1000 it literally does nothing. Either that or it multiplies it by a ridiculously large factor that seems to be completely random and quickly leads to a superexponential loop that crashes my game. Basically, addition itself is broken. This means no NG+4 and no NG↑↑↑. It sucks. Fortunately I'm working on a solution - a new library to store numbers so big your brain can't comprehend the number of digits in the base-10 representation of the number of digits in the number. The numbers will be stored double-logarithmically, instead of single-logarithmically. The accuracy at low values will be absolutely terrible - it will be even less accurate than logarithmica. (Javascript likes to do this stupid thing where it randomly changes numbers by the tiniest amount, for example, 4 + 1 is usually 5 but is occasionally 4.99999999999 or 5.00000000001. Not really a big deal most of the time unless you require whole numbers for array indexes or something. But 10^10^5 and 10^10^5.00000000001 are very different. That tiny error could multiply a number by 2, randomly, unnoticeably, and for literally no reason. (Again, multiplying by 2 is insignificant at >1e9Qa anyway, but in the early game, especially during an NG-x run, it kind of defeats the purpose.) Essentially, it fucks stuff up.) I have some ideas for workarounds, though, like a combination of break_infinity and logarithmica where the exponent stored by the break_infinity part is a logarithm itself, or something similar. It should theoretically get the job done until 1e1e9Qa. EDIT: Apparently, Aarex is also working on this. Hopefully he finishes it soon.)<br><br></li>
			<li>The "Autobuyer Autobuyer" option from QoL is completely defunct. Pressing it will just toggle the Replicanti button. (It won't break anything, though.)</li>
			<li>I somehow added a bug where the game will become completely unresponsive when you reload the page. It doesn't even pop up the stuck window. I could only fix it by clearing my local storage.</li>
			<li>I planned to add the option of merging NGUd and NG+++ into one large super-lategame mod, NGUd+. You can start playing it - just click the NG++ button an extra time. Just don't ex-dilate or the game will crash.</li>
			<li>NGUd definitely needs optimization (it lags when you buy black hole dimensions, especially when in NGUd+, and the black hole rendering itself is laggy at large sizes). I'll get around to fixing it at some point.</li>
			<li>NGUd+ needs to be rebalanced - you can't get anywhere near enough TP for the first mastery studies upgrade, even with Secrets on.</li>
			<li>Some of the loaded files are hidden by the mode selection UI.</li>
			<li>NG-- flips its shit when you dilate time. It clearly wasn't designed with players actually making it to 13000 theorems in mind, since its massive buffs were created to counteract the dilation effect, and dilation doesn't slow down the game's progress any more. The result is that the player gets a ton of tachyon particles and quickly exceeds the 1e9Qa softcap, which crashes the game.</li>
			<li>The NG--- Tickspeed Boost autobuyer will always buy up to the number in its Bulk Buy box, even if the maximum can't be afforded, as long as you can buy at least 1 tickspeed boost.</li>
